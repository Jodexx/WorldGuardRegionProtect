## Opportunities

* By entering the name of the region in the plugin config.yml, you will added it protection by plugin. No one can break any blocks in the region that is registered in config.yml. Even the operators are not able to do this!

(This plugin is for extended protection of an existing region from worldguard. For example from possible damage regions from the administration(who have permission access from plugin), or from operators.)

## With plugin you can do advanced protect from

1. Cannot place or break any block on region.
2. Protect frame, painting from any damage(arrows, trident, snowball, eggs, enderpearl and damaged from player).
3. Protect from any change in the frame (and glow frame from 1.18).
4. Cannot taking or damage armor from/on armor stand.
5. Cannot use lava/water bucket in region.
6. TNT, minecart with tnt, Respawn Anchor and ender crystal cant damaged any blocks in region.
7. Support for banned dangerous commands. Separate commands were added and tested used by FastAsyncWorldEdit\WorldEdit in the protected region.
8. Cannot anyone remove region or change flags in protected region. Example just using like "/rg rem your_rg" and etc.
9. Create a special region inside the protected region in which you can break and place or only break (specified in config.yml)

## Permissions

1. If you need give access into region for Builder team or any member, just add permissions on LuckPerms or PermissionsEx: wgrp.regionprotect
2. The star permissions in LuckPerms or PermissionsEx may will be gived access to protected region by WGRP.
